# Debugging with VS Code Short Course

Are you still debugging your code with print statements and commenting out chunks of code? Would you like a more efficient way to observe and test your programs? Then you should consider incorporating Visual Studio Code’s (VS Code) built-in debugger!
In this workshop we will cover how to setup and use the VS Code debugger for testing a software program at run time. You will learn how to pause your code at key locations in your code (breakpoints) and observe and/or update your project’s variables.
In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, you will need to bring a personal laptop computer. You will also need to either have VS Code installed on your laptop computer or have a research computing account so that you can use VS Code through OnDemand. If you need assistance with creating an account take a look at our short video, Creating an Account.
